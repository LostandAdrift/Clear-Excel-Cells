# Clear-Excel-Cells
Copies top level worksheet (formatting and values) and creates a new sheet from it, clearing out specific values




# About the Program
This is a simple GUI I created to speed up the repetitive task of creating new sheets in excel files and clearing out old cells. The GUI will let you 
browse in both the local and shared drives and will create a failure window that should point you in the right direction if
it failures to generate the new sheet. It will keep the old formatting and will not delete any data in the previous cell.

# Prerequisites
You'll need tkinter, openpyxl and pathlib, the first of which comes standard with python and the latter two are included in Conda.
